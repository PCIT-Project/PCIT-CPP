# Contributing to PCIT

Thanks for your interest in the PCIT Project!

## Code contributions
At this time, the PCIT Project Team is not accepting any code contributions. However, this is most likely going to change in the future!

## Issues
Issues are welcomed. However, since this project is in its infancy, expect that things may change soon. When creating an issue, please:
- Tag the issue appropriately ([more below](#tagging))
- Make sure there isn't already an issue that exists that is on the same topic
- Give detailed information
- Follow the [code of conduct](https://github.com/PCIT-Project/PCIT-CPP/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)

### Tagging
At a minimum, two tags are required for any issue: the category of the issue and the part of the PCIT project. For example, if you have a feature request for the Panther language, you would add the tags `Feature Request` and `Panther (language)`. Similarly, if you came across a fatal error when using the Panther compiler executable (pthr), you would add the tags `Bug` and `Panther (pthr)`.
